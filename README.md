Introduction:
The project addresses a binary image classification task, utilizing a dataset composed of labeled images. The primary objective is to develop a deep learning classifier and assess its performance using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. This involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with specified architecture and hyperparameters. The dataset is crucial for training and validation, containing images with corresponding binary labels. The overarching aim is to explore the synergy between deep learning and traditional machine learning methods, specifically evaluating the SVM model's performance on features extracted from the trained CNN.

Methodology:
The deep learning classifier architecture comprises convolutional and fully connected layers, with activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions tailored for effective training. Features are extracted from the validation set using a chosen fully connected layer. Additionally, an SVM model, either linear or non-linear, is employed, with potential hyperparameter tuning through GridSearchCV. The pipeline involves training the deep learning classifier, extracting features, training the SVM model, and evaluating overall performance.

Results:
The results section presents the accuracy achieved by the deep learning classifier on the validation set. Subsequently, it discusses the accuracy attained by the SVM model on the same validation set using the extracted features. Any notable observations or differences between the two models' performances are highlighted, shedding light on the effectiveness of the combined approach.

Evaluation and Discussion:
The SVM model's performance on the test set is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A comparative analysis between the SVM model's performance on the test set and the deep learning classifier's performance on the validation set provides insights into the models' relative strengths and weaknesses. The discussion section reflects on the overall approach, emphasizing the applicability of using deep learning features for SVM classification. Strengths and limitations are addressed, offering recommendations for future improvements or alternative methodologies.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the trained SVM model's key findings are summarized, emphasizing the effectiveness of leveraging features extracted from a deep learning classifier for binary image classification. The note concludes with reflections on the collaboration between deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, providing suggestions for future enhancements or alternative strategies. The dataset used plays a pivotal role in shaping the outcomes of the study, and its characteristics contribute to the broader understanding of the applied methodology.
